I'm a final-year BEng (Hons) Software Engineering student at the University of Westminster, passionate about crafting intelligent, user-centric solutions through AI/ML and full-stack development. I led an innovative adaptive gamification platform using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to transform programming education. As a contributor to the NBQSA Merit Award-winning OPTIMAXER AI project (2023), I specialize in building scalable AI systems, optimizing prompts, and delivering seamless web and mobile experiences. Check out my work at [my portfolio](https://portfolio-p862.vercel.app/)!
